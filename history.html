	<p> <em style="font-size: 13px;"> At first there was nothing... </em> <br> <br>
		Then, one day an all-powerful being came along named Oliver Newland and decided he would make BAG BAG BAG. 
		For those of you who are new to the program, BAG stands for Boys and Girls. Oliver began the program with practically nothing. Before recruiting any players, Oliver decided to set a foundation and core principles for BAG. He delveloped the Three Pillars of Bag. Anyone who plays will have to learn and live by the Three Pillars.

		The next step Oliver made was recruiting enough players to be able to compete. He asked some of the Tufts Ultimate Frisbee program's Emen and Bmen to join BAG. The results were positive however unfortunately many of the Emen lied and played for other higher level club teams like Big Wrench. This left BAG with low numbers in the beginning. But Oliver was determined and asked one of his friends, Brunch, to help with some administration. Together the two recruited a bunch of Winchester High School players through a connection that one of the BAG players had with Winchester's coach. The team went on to participate in Philly Open and then went on to play at Sectionals where BAG finished in 10th place. 
		<br> <br> 
		<strong style="color: #ff1919; font-size: 20px;"> Year 2 </strong> <br>
		In year 2, Oliver quit management and Brunch took it upon himself to not let BAG die. Brunch continued to preach the Three Pillars of BAG and recruited a few skilled college players from local colleges. Brunch's hard work was able to bring BAG to a better end of season finish because of the better consistency on the roster. 
		<br> <br> 
		<strong style="color: #ff1919; font-size: 20px;"> Year 3 </strong> <br>
		In year 3, Brunch recurited a fellow Emen named Aaron to join him in running the team. For the first year, BAG held actual tryouts. There was no more worry about not having enough players. Brunch and Aaron actually had to make cuts in order to stay competitive for tournmaents. Overall, BAG played way better in Year 3, had way more consistency, and even had weekly practices. In the end, BAG finsihed in 5th place at Sectionals which led to a bid to Regionals. This was a huge accomplishment. A small club team with minimal all-stars was able to reach club Regionals.

		<strong style="color: #ff1919; font-size: 20px;"> Year 4 </strong> <br> 
		To be determined... Summer 2020 <br>
